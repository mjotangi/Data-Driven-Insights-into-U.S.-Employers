Hello, I am Megha, an international student pursuing my dream here in the United States. However, to stay here, I require an H-1B visa. Obtaining this visa is crucial for me.

I recently completed my Masterâ€™s in Information Technology with distinction at Arizona State University. I have a 30-day window post-graduation to secure a job. Unfortunately, in 2024, companies are unwilling to sponsor H-1B visas.
